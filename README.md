# Weather.io

Weather.io is a web widget built with JavaScript, 
inspired by https://codepen.io/aritha/pen/MaQEVX & https://codepen.io/jerrylow/pen/KaPvNa

Current design is based off a known zipcode; however, the API allows for lat, long and code can be updated to support geolocation. 

API Usage: https://openweathermap.org
